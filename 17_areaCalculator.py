'''The user will be prompted with a menu where he/she will select a shape 
Then the user will give the appropriate information needed to solve for 
the area, and the computer will give the area! Hope you all have taken 
geometry!'''

#Basics
#Rectangle      axb
#Square         axa
#Triangle       1/2ah (where a is length of ground site and h is height
#Circle         Ï€xr**2 (where r is the radius)

#Fancy
#Parallelogramm axh (where a is length of ground site and h is the heigth)
#Trapezoid      1/2 (a+c ) xh where a is the ground, c the opposite site 

#I'll just do one of them so everything else can be solved via adapting
#my procedure for the rectangle

#As I found out when doing a multi-line-string with ''' Python also 
#takes care of newlines and other formatting by itself.
