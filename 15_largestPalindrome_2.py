'''A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome 
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers'''

#So I think what I first have to do is get all possible factorials. 

#Guess the largest possible palindrome made from two 3 digit numbers 
#would be 999999 BUT: Can it be calculated by two three digit numbers?

#What I have to do now is move the palindrome list backwards, because we
#want to find the gand find the largest palindrome. And the one that 
#can be made of two 3 digit factors

#I think I need a dict datatype for this kind of question. So for every
#palindrome, store the 3 digit factors because else I'll get a wild 
#collection of factors not allocated to it's fitting palindrome 

#What I observed is following: 
#See for example palindrome 1221. The factorials are following:
#1
#3
#11
#33
#37
#111
#407
#1221
#-> It's always the first and the last element that make a factor-pair, 
#so e.g. 1x1221, 3x407 etc.

#Adding palindromes as keys to the dict
#for i in palindromes:
    #as values take the Factors for this Palindrome
    #dict_for_value_pairs[i]=returnFactorial(i)
    #->>>> Problem here is that returnFactorial() prints the factorials
    #and I have no clue how to insert them directly fitting to it's palindrome
